View Encapsulation
  if you inspect your components you'll see they get an attribute like
  "_ngcontent-pax-1." Angular uses these to apply styles only to the
  appropriate components. This emulates "shadow DOM" behaviour.

Data Binding

{{ }} string interpolation
<button [disabled]="expression that evaluates to type expected by disabled attribute"> property binding
<button (click)="expression to be called when click even is fired"> event binding
<input [(ngModel)]="bound model object"> two-way binding
