View Encapsulation
  if you inspect your components you'll see they get an attribute like
  "_ngcontent-pax-1." Angular uses these to apply styles only to the
  appropriate components. This emulates "shadow DOM" behaviour.

Data Binding Types

  {{ }} string interpolation
  <button [disabled]="expression that evaluates to type expected by disabled attribute"> property binding
  <button (click)="expression to be called when click even is fired"> event binding
  <input [(ngModel)]="bound model object"> two-way binding

What you can bind to

  Native DOM properties:
    <img [src]="...">
    <img (click)="...">

  Angular Directive properties:
    <div [ngClass]="...">
    <dig (ngSubmit)="...">

  Component properties:
    <my-component [initObj]="...">
    <my-component (rndEvent)="...">

Creating custom "bindpoints" in your own components

  property binding: import Input then @Input() propertyName: string;
  event binding: @Output() eventName: new EventEmitter();
